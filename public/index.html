Starting from the <q cite="">Matrix</q> times, where the audience sees only a black screen with green text is unimaginable currently today. How it quickly evolved within a matter of two decades is remarkable within itself. Going through dial up phases to applications on the first smart phone in a short amount of time proves the success of the new technology era.

  My visions of the web would be through the eyes of Virtual Reality. Where we will put on a pair of goggles and <em>surf</em> through the web using <strong>sensory gloves</strong>. Children will be able to gain <u>exceptional</u> educational experiences through using virtual reality. Our government could create peaceful interactions with others from around the world through a Skype session in the VR space. Cultures would be more transparent to individuals who do not have the economic means to experience the countries they choose to visit.
